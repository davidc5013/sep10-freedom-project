# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Animation
### 3/8/2025

* For some reason while tinkering with animation and making it to repeat it wouldnt work with `class` or ` @Keyframe`
*  So i used `animation-iteration-count` to replace that code and it actually worked so it would look like for an example
*  ` animation:heartBeat;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-count: `
*  Also while tinkering it was recently today i wanted to see if my old notes would still work, `hovering`, `background-color` so once i tried it actually worked so its good to know
* the way i looked through my hard work was my SEP NOTES and [Freecodecamp]{https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design}
* My only question is why the `animation-duration`, `animation-delay` and `animation-repeat` dont work.
* Thats all for today, Have a pepermint day❗️

* Hello again, today i was exploring [Freecodecamp]{https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design} lessons on CSS to look around, and it caught my eye to make objects move.
* At first i wanted to make images aminated but I couldn´t get it, but ill retry it on another log.
Today i wanted to talk about moving objects animated. Mostly the square changing color and moving not the circle, thats for another log.
* While tinkering with the CSS, In order for the box to move it need to be a postion of relative which is this code
`postion:relative;` and i didn´t realize until i looked the example, If there was no `position` it would stay as the orignal background
* Also while doing the `@keyframes` you have to use the `percentage` to move it. You can move the object in anyway how but using `top,left,right,bottom`.
* Heres a SS of some of my code i did
<img scr="image.png" alt=image>
* Thats all i did for today, i still want to know how i can make images animated?
* Have a peppermint day!
