# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Animation
### 3/8/2025

* For some reason while tinkering with animation and making it to repeat it wouldnt work with `class` or ` @Keyframe`
*  So i used `animation-iteration-count` to replace that code and it actually worked so it would look like for an example
*  ` animation:heartBeat;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-count: `
*  Also while tinkering it was recently today i wanted to see if my old notes would still work, `hovering`, `background-color` so once i tried it actually worked so its good to know
* the way i looked through my hard work was my SEP NOTES and [Freecodecamp]{https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design}
* My only question is why the `animation-duration`, `animation-delay` and `animation-repeat` dont work.
* Thats all for today, Have a pepermint day❗️
