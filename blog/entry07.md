### Content
Hello, It wasn't that long since i wrote my blog 6 but a lot happen through that time, My whole class finished they're Freedom Project (Hooray) but also we took around 2-3 weeks to share and present our project to the class and within the middle of the last week, we presented in the expo and it was fun, scary but fun.
### TakeAways
But something I learned through both the expo and class presentation was different yet similar, for one, having self-awareness when I'm speaking because when presenting in both events, I was giggling or stumbling on my own words because I was nervous which led me to don't stress over anything that didn't or won't happen. I would have this picture in my head the judges would be like judges but in a bad way but it 
never happened. Now a TakeAway I did have in the class presentation was to have more of a script instead of trying to do something off the top of my head. Although it might work sometimes, it usually doesn't work, you don't have to say every word like a robot but more of a guide, and if you want you can improvise a bit. A takeaway is wishing I could always do a bit more on my project because as Mr.Muller says, there won't be a perfect website for us, and it's true but it can always feel like you can do more. If you want to see my slides below and my elevator pitch, Thank you!
