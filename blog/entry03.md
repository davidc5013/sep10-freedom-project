### Context
Last entry i was talking about the research on my topic wish is fitness, and why i choose that certain topic. A lot things happen after that, I would have to finalize all my sources and resaerch for Part A (the Present time) I would have to start planning my plan A which means having introduction and planning. And like a week ago our teacher (Mr. Muller) assigin us to do Part B, which is brainstorming and finalizing everything including Part B but i was gone for a week but then i catched up, and thats what im going to be talking about today.

#### Part B brainstomring
When it came time to brainstorm it was complete brain fog because it felt like the things wouldn´t really help people, it would be more like a cool thing but wouldn´t be useful in general. So the first thing was to realize who is going to be my target audience and what do they need or want. I started to think of struggles of being an athlete and then i realized that theres athletes that play multiple sports and sometime it usally playing with sports ball. and it can get quite expensive to buy the balls or gear; then it occured, what if there was a invention that would be a bunch of sports ball into one. A ball that will change using small needles that changes the air preasure thru an app that sends codes to the needle, the texture would change as well when you select the sport you need, itll change from the inside out. You would have to repair it because the little needles might get broken, it would be 
call allball. 

When i was thinking of that invention i feel like, i had to think of one more for people who maybe just want to lift weights or go to the gym regularly. And a struggle that can occur once in a while is that when performing exercises it can be hard to notice if your doing it right or wrong. So what if there was mini sensors clips that would record you doing your set and when recording it would look at your form and take notes on whats right and what need to be improved. once your done with the exerises it would take 1-2 mins to finally create a hologram and it would explain to you whats happening when your using the muscule group, how your form is, whats good about it and how you can improve on it.

#### Finalizing my planning

Now once i created my brainstorming, i would have to add it with my part A that includes my intro/context and all the things i have researched into mini categories like workouts at home and gym workouts which is pretty self-explain. somethings that i found was [tonal](https://www.tonal.com/about/)
