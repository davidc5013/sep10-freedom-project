#### Context
Hello, Last time we talked it was about the brainstorming of my part A and part B, now were talking about project tool. Mr.Muller was catching our class up with the agenda and the next step was choosing a project tool which means a property were going to use for the website were making. Mr.Muller gave us two weeks to decide on what tool on choosing.

#### Project tool
After a week my final two were A frame or Animation and although A frame looked cool I perfered Animation because I had previous 
experience with it but it´s been month but also cause as i was looking there was new animation properties i didn´t know much about so i took as a way to sharpen my skills in this topic.
#### Tinkering
When I was reading animation website, i notice there was many things i had in mote notes, although there wasn´t any hovering animation showing just more presentation. So to kind of fresh my mind  i went to my IDE
In the first example it showed a different way of inputting animation which was by class which i never did before. The example i saw was
`<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce"> an elemant elemant</h1>`
 the way it was explained was animate animated was the class name and the 2nd animate on the last word you choose the animation. The class was used for direct. But there was the method of using keyframes. But i was lost when i tried using `@keyframe` it wouldn´t work until i realized i had to write the whole class and not the element. 
 There was many ways to use the animation and how it works so i used two h1 elements and one was with the `class` while the other one was pure `@keyframes`. Heres a ss:

Something that i notice was that i wanted my animation to repeat but it wouldnt and there was a code proprety that was called, `animate__repeat` and it worked on `class` but it didn´t work on `@keyframes` i tried adding the `--animate__repeast` but it wouldn´t work but i remebered during freecode camp in my notes there something called `animation-iteration-count that somewaht solve the issue for me.
Some good reminders i found as i was playing around was as the animation duration increase in secs the animations goes really slow and as it decrease it speeds up.
