####choosing a topic
<p>The topic that I decided to talk about is fitness and well being such as working out and overall just being healthy. The reason why I choose this topic is that since quarantine occurred, I started to care less about my well-being physically and mentally but then I took action to improve myself by going to the gym where I learned how to be disciplined, pushing my limits but also help my friends on working on themselves. And when this project was presented, I knew technology would have a big impact on our well-being. Before deciding on this topic, there were other topics like automobiles and architecture. The articles that I found helpful and interesting were <a href=¨https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-ultimate-guide-to-health-and-fitness-tech¨The Ultimate Guide to Health and Fitness Tech for 2024</a>
