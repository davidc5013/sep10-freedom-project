# Software 
* Apple fitness
* Planet fitness app
* Gym Master
 
 On how i found these software apps was by first searching up on google "Fitness app" and after that i started looking around and it gave me a list on softwares,But then i stumble upon a article [I Tried Apple Fitness Plusâ€”Here's My Honest Review](https://parade.com/health/apple-fitness-plus-review) and it was about the author of article trying out the apple fitness app and plus which is just a "premium" version of it. it has its benefits and cons such as:

 * The solid pros are
* Make its easy for a individual to workout
* A person can make their own home workouts to fit their needs
* Cons: It's only exclusive to apple products
* The longest classes are 45 minutes long which from some people its not that long.

So after reading the article, i decided to look around the website to see if there is any articles or ads that are relevant to my topic, then a advertisement pop of [planet fitness](https://www.planetfitness.com/mobileapp).In the app pros:
* The ability to let you know if your near planet fitness is busy or free-
* The app has qr codes so when you enter the code, you'll enter the gym faster.
* They also have workouts based on your level of fitness.
* Cons: there's not that much features on the app so its limited
