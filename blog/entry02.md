Like i said in the previous entry,Physical health and fitness are very important to everybody lifes and thats why i decided to choose is it as my topic. Ever since me and my classmates choose our topic, Our teacher assgin us every monday a task to research software and hardware in that is about our topic. On OCT 21 we researched on software this is what i found

# Software 
* Apple fitness
* Planet fitness app
* Gym Master
 
 On how i found these software apps was by first searching up on google "Fitness app" and after that i started looking around and it gave me a list on softwares,But then i stumble upon a article [I Tried Apple Fitness Plus—Here's My Honest Review](https://parade.com/health/apple-fitness-plus-review) and it was about the author of article trying out the apple fitness app and plus which is just a "premium" version of it. it has its benefits and cons such as:

 * The solid pros are
* Make its easy for a individual to workout by using a tranier
* A person can make their own home workouts to fit their needs
* Cons: It's only exclusive to apple products
* The longest classes are 45 minutes long which from some people its not that long.

So after reading the article, i decided to look around the website to see if there is any articles or ads that are relevant to my topic, then a advertisement pop of [planet fitness](https://www.planetfitness.com/mobileapp).In the app pros:
* The ability to let you know if your near planet fitness is busy or free-
* The app has qr codes so when you enter the code, you'll enter the gym faster.
* They also have workouts based on your level of fitness.
* Cons: there's not that much features on the app so its limited for example
* you would need a membership for planet fitness in the gym
* It not really flexible with people that have a busy schedule

 After that i decided to go in a different direction by searching up ¨Fitness software and i was scrolling down there was information about a article and there was a website called [Gym Master](https://www.gymmaster.com/), Gymmaster is a management to make it easy keep track record on your health.The website pros:
* You can book classes with trainers so you already know when to workout
* It has Ai generated conversation to help you improve with fitness
* Cons: The ai generator and other benefits cost a bit more.
* The ai generator is powered by chat gpt
* its okay generator but just like wikipedia its a okay starting point.
 And thats all i collected for software on my topic.

   Hard ware

Then after the monday where we researched about software it was the same for hardware. So i started searching up fitness gadgets and one option that was pretty cool was called ["Tonal"](https://www.tonal.com/blog/), Tonal is a hardware home gym muscle build machine.The machine uses technology to keep track your progress and make it easy.The pros of tonal is: 
* It helps keep track on your progress
* Allows you to work from home
* Its like a software within the machine itself so you choose workouts
* The machine has up to 200 pounds of weight for working out
Custom program
* Up to 245 adoptive movements
cons:
* Not affordable for many people
* For bodybuilding or anything very serious, 200 pounds isn't the best max
* You also have to buy the program and fiance purchase is also not cheap
* You would have the buy more accessories

Then i went to search "physical fitness tech gadget"s As i was scrolling through the options, the same one where i found Tonal, i stumble across something called [Smart Jump Rope](https://tangramfactory.com/smartrope/en/), The smart jump rope is like a regular jump rope BUT in the name it says smart, and advanced since it has technology.The benefits:
* It keep tracks of the amount times you jump
* Also track your progress on how active you are
* LED lights within the jump rope
* You can use it for 30 days based on 1 charge
* You can have small fun competitions thru the app
Cons
* There's not that much difference between this one and a regular one
* The jump rope itself a bit pricey 199-299 w/o the membership
In my opnion its an okay product, there is not much difference between this and a regular jump rope, but it depends on the person if they want to check their progress but you can do it as well with a regular jump rope, Thats around it for my hardware exploration.
