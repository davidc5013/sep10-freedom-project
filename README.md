# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **David Culebro**

## Context
Whats up, I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project about what I learned in this program year and how I used it to make a final product, which is my website, which informs about the topic I chose at the beginning of the year.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Phsyical Health**. I used the following skills i picked up during the year 
* Html
* Css
  and including a tool i choose independently to make my website stand out, **Animation.css**
