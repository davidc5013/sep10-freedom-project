# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* say a story on how i wanted a website to inform me starting a fitness journey

## Product
* A small gif of the website

## Process
* Getting the parts of the content
* Making the wireframe
* making the mvp/bones
* choosing the tools and adding it to the website
* small little issues getting introduced as the way go on
* polishing it a bit.
## Conclusion
* TakeAways:
* Know the difference between breaks and procrastinate
* There would be times where i would do certians parts of the code and make sure it worked then taking small little breaks to refresh but there would be times i just do a bit of work and say i deserve a break then a whole day goes by and i wasted a day where i could check the responsive part, if the animation is there, if the WOW.JS couldve been working


<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
